    <h3> About Me</h3>
    <p> I am a motivated and technically proficient senior at Boston University, specializing in low-level systems with a strong passion for hardware technologies. With a solid foundation in system architecture and embedded systems, I am poised to receive my bachelor's degree in 2025.
        Throughout my academic career, I have honed my skills in designing and troubleshooting complex hardware systems. My coursework and hands-on projects have equipped me with a deep understanding of hardware design principles, digital logic, and microprocessor architecture. I have successfully completed projects involving the design of embedded systems that interact with real-time sensors and actuators, demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in practical applications.

        In addition to my technical skills, I possess strong problem-solving abilities and a keen attention to detail, which are essential in the fast-paced field of hardware technology. My collaborative projects have refined my team-working skills, and I have consistently taken leadership roles in group assignments, ensuring projects are delivered on time and to specifications.
